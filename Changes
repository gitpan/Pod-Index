Revision history for Pod-Index

0.12  2005-08-14
        - Case-insensitive search option. NOTE: as a consequence, indexes 
          built with previous versions are not likely to work with this one.
          Also note that the keys for the hashref returned by
          Pod::Index::Builder->pod_index are now normalized to lowercase.
        - Added a 'keyword' property to Entry objects.
        - Eliminate duplicate search results.
        - Fixed some typos and documentation errors.

        - The hashref returned by Pod::Index::Builder->pod_index now has 
          Pod::Index::Entry as values.
        - Various bug and typo fixes.
